Burger-App

This is a burger-logger restaurant app. It lets users input the names of burgers they’d like to eat.

The user submits a burger’s name. The app then displays the burger on the left side of the page. This burger is waiting to be devoured. It also has “devour it” button attached to it. When the user clicks on the button, the burger should move to the right side of the page.

The app should store every burger in a database, regardless of whether it is eaten or not.

The following technologies will be used:

MySQL
Node
Express
Handlebars
Homemade ORM

This app follows the MVC design pattern.

MySQL and Node query and route date into the app.

Handlebars generates the HTML.
